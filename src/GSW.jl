"""
    gsw_c_from_sp(sp, t, p)

Calculates conductivity, C, from (SP,t,p) using PSS-78 in the range
2 < SP < 42.  If the input Practical Salinity is less than 2 then a
modified form of the Hill et al. (1986) fomula is used for Practical
Salinity.  The modification of the Hill et al. (1986) expression is to
ensure that it is exactly consistent with PSS-78 at SP = 2.

The conductivity ratio returned by this function is consistent with the
input value of Practical Salinity, SP, to 2x10^-14 psu over the full
range of input parameters (from pure fresh water up to SP = 42 psu).
This error of 2x10^-14 psu is machine precision at typical seawater
salinities.  This accuracy is achieved by having four different
polynomials for the starting value of Rtx (the square root of Rt) in
four different ranges of SP, and by using one and a half iterations of
a computationally efficient modified Newton-Raphson technique (McDougall
and Wotherspoon, 2012) to find the root of the equation.

Note that strictly speaking PSS-78 (Unesco, 1983) defines Practical
Salinity in terms of the conductivity ratio, R, without actually
specifying the value of C(35,15,0) (which we currently take to be
42.9140 mS/cm).

This function evaluates the pressure integral of specific volume using

If the ice contains no salt (e.g. if it is of glacial origin), then the
input 'SA_seaice' should be set to zero.

Ice formed at the sea surface (sea ice) typically contains between 2 g/kg

ice Ih plus brine) and this programme returns NaN's if the input
SA_seaice is greater than 15 g/kg.  If the SA_seaice input is not zero,
usually this would imply that the pressure p should be zero, as sea ice
only occurs near the sea surface.  The code does not impose that p = 0
if SA_seaice is non-zero.  Rather, this is left to the user.

The Absolute Salinity, SA_brine, of the brine trapped in little pockets
in the sea ice, is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice Ih that
surrounds these pockets.  As the sea ice temperature, t_seaice, may be

    gsw_turner_rsubrho(rarray, nx, iarray)

Calculates the Turner angle and the Rsubrho as a function of pressure
down a vertical water column.  These quantities express the relative
contributions of the vertical gradients of Conservative Temperature
and Absolute Salinity to the vertical stability (the square of the
Brunt-Vaisala Frequency squared, N^2).  Tu and Rsubrho are evaluated at
the mid pressure between the individual data points in the vertical.

Note that in the double-diffusive literature, papers concerned with
the "diffusive" form of double-diffusive convection often define the
stability ratio as the reciprocal of what is defined here as the
stability ratio.

Piecewise-Hermite algorithm from

Extrapolation to points outside the range is done by setting those
points to the corresponding end values.

The input x must be monotonically increasing; the interpolation points,
xi, may be in any order, but the algorithm will be faster if they are
monotonic, increasing or decreasing.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if it fails because there are fewer than 2 points,
2 if it fails because x is not increasing.
Consistent with other GSW-C code at present, the memory allocations
are assumed to succeed.
